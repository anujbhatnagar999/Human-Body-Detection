# Human-Body-Detection
THis code uses HOG and HAAR cascade to detect diferrent human body parts, like upper body, lower body, arms etc.
It can be intergrated with different projects like I used it for disaster management where people stuck in floods or forest fires can be
detected using this piece of code.
